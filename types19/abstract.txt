We observe that normalization by evaluation (NbE) for simply-typed lambda-calculus with weakly extensional coproducts can be carried out in a weak bi-cartesian closed category of presheaves equipped with a monad that allows us to perform case distinction on neutral terms of sum type.  The placement of the monad influences the normal forms we obtain: for instance, placing the monad on coproducts gives us eta-long beta-pi normal forms where pi refers to permutation of case distinctions out of elimination positions.  We further observe that placing the monad on every coproduct is rather wasteful, and an optimal placement of the monad can be determined by considering polarized simple types inspired by focalization.  Polarization classifies types into positive and negative, and it is sufficient to place the monad at the embedding of positive types into negative ones. Call-by-push-value (CBPV) is a calculus with such polarization, and we study NbE for this calculus.
